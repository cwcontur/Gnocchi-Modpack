### [Lootr](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lootr)

What is Lootr? It's simple: unique inventories for every loot chest for every player on a server.

**What does that mean?** When you open a loot chest (distinctly textured from Vanilla chests), what items you get are unique to you (as though you had opened an Ender Chest). This means no empty chests, and no picking up other people's trash!

**How does this help?** For multiplayer servers, especially those with mods that depend on items looted from chests, it means finding loot closer to home. No more extensive, server-draining trips generating hundreds of chunks in search of a fresh chest.

When you open a Lucky Block, it will randomly choose one of over 100 possible outcomes. These cover most components of the game, including items, chests, monsters, structures, potions, enchantments, etc.
