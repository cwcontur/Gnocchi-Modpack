You want power? We got power. Bigger Reactors is an energy generation mod based on the original by Erogenous Beef. Semi-inspired by real reactor designs, this mod allows for mix-n-match reactors to generate lots of power. Each block you place can change the overall performance of a reactor.

- More power? Uh-huh.

- A giant reactor just to flex on your friends? Sure.

All you need to get started is some reactor casing, a power tap, access port, fuel & control rods, and terminal. Then just pipe/hopper in some Yellorium or Blutonium, flip the switch, and you're off!

Need more power? Just build some Bigger Reactors.

## [CC: Tweaked](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked)

CC: Tweaked is a mod for *Minecraft* which adds programmable computers, turtles and more to the game. A fork of the much-beloved ComputerCraft, it continues its legacy with better performance, stability, and a wealth of new features.

### Features

Controlled using the [Lua programming language](https://www.lua.org/), CC: Tweaked's computers provides all the tools you need to start writing code and automating your Minecraft world.

![](../docs/assets/basicterminal.png)

While computers are incredibly powerful, they're rather limited by their inability to move about. Turtles are the solution here. They can move about the world, placing and breaking blocks, swinging a sword to protect you from zombies, or whatever else you program them to!

![](../docs/assets/turtle.png)

Not all problems can be solved with a pickaxe though, and so CC: Tweaked also provides a bunch of additional peripherals for your computers. You can play a tune with speakers, display text or images on a monitor, connect all your computers together with modems, and much more.

Computers can now also interact with inventories such as chests, allowing you to build complex inventory and item management systems.

![](../docs/assets/peripherals.png)

### Getting Started

While ComputerCraft is lovely for both experienced programmers and for people who have never coded before, it can be a little daunting getting started. Thankfully, there's several fantastic tutorials out there:

- **[Direwolf20's ComputerCraft tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrUHUhfCY5A&ab_channel=direwolf20)**

- **[Sethbling's ComputerCraft Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSsx4VSe-Uk&ab_channel=SethBling)**

- **[Lyqyd's Computer Basics 1](http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/15033-computer-basics-i/)**

Once you're a little more familiar with the mod, the wiki provides more detailed documentation on the various APIs and peripherals provided by the mod.

## [Dimensional Dungeons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dimensional-dungeons)

About Dimensional Dungeons
Dimensional Dungeons adds limitless procedurally generated dungeons to *Minecraft*! These dungeons are all placed in a single, separate dimension which can be accessed from a portal anywhere on the Overworld. (Such as in your base!) This makes the dungeons themselves renewable and it provides challenging, replayable content.

The dungeon dimension limits building and block breaking. This allows for a proper adventure mode-like experience on a survival server. For example, I can use pistons in my traps without giving the player free pistons. Obstacle courses can't be bridged over. Combat can't be trivialized by building fences around mobs. And light and darkness matter when you can't place torches!

Besides challenges in room design the dungeons are also randomly populated with enemies and worthwhile loot! Many rooms with valuable treasure chests require solving a puzzle that will test your knowledge of *Minecraft* game mechanics. Currently all of the builds are 'vanilla' and no modded blocks or command blocks are used. The goal is to feel vanilla-lite and to be fair to the player.

## [Flux Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flux-networks)

## [Hostile Neural Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hostile-neural-networks)

Hostile Neural Networks is a mob based on Deep Mob Learning for 1.16.5 and higher. It allows you to train data models and run simulations, producing mob predictions, which can be used to generate mob loot.

The fundamental unit of this mod is the Data Model - an item which holds information about an entity that you can utilize to generate their drops. To get a Data Model, you must first craft a Data Model Framework, and use it on the target entity to build the model. Once you have your model, you will have to train it.

Training a Data Model can be done in one of two ways, with a Deep Learner or with a Simulation Chamber. The deep learner allows you to store a few data models within, and kills you receive will begin to train the model. All models start out in the Faulty state, and must be trained up to Basic in the deep learner.

## [Immersive Engineering](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering)

Immersive Engineering is a tech mod with a certain charm, based on the ideas and concepts, and with most assets created by Damien Hazard.

*Overall, it's about realism-inspired technology:*

Instead of glowing red tubes, it offers actual, hanging powerlines.
Instead of one block that magically spits out dusts when ore is put in, it offers a crusher, a big multiblock (5x3x3) that features rotating wheels and spits out particles as it breaks the ore.
Instead of a Laser that turns power into magical light and ores, it offers an Excavator, another massive, resource intensive, multiblock (3x7x8) which digs ores out of the ground with a big rotating bucketwheel.

IE is about making tech mods more balanced and more pretty, and adding its own twist by going for retro-futurism (think BioShock, Order 1886, SkyCaptain and the World of Tomorrow) rather than clinical white+grey future cubes.

Here at Mekanism, Inc., we bring you a suite of low, mid, and high tier machinery to elevate your archaic home and inefficient resource processing to the 21st century. With our collection of high-tech tools, high-end energy generators, advanced transmission systems and intricate processing mechanisms, you’ll find yourself relieved of the tedious tasks of ‘mining’ and ‘crafting’ and quickly progressing to new levels of technological enlightenment.

You may not realize it, but every time you smelt an ore directly into its respective ingot, you’re wasting the majority of what you’ve mined. Mekanism’s team of experienced chemical and mechanical engineers have developed advanced ore processing machinery to extract resources from ores with utmost efficiency. With our purification, dissolution, chemical injection, and crystallization technologies, you can now double, triple, quadruple, even quintuple your ingot production per ore, given enough infrastructure and energy.

Our engineering team understands and embraces gradual technological progression. For whatever stage of gameplay you’ve reached, we offer a tier of machinery to suit your needs. Every Mekanism machine can be upgraded to a factory, allowing you to process, 3 (basic), 5 (advanced), 7 (elite), or even 9 (ultimate) different items at once -- in a single machine! No more are the rows, even walls of slow and ugly furnaces that once plagued your home. Condense your machinery infrastructure with Mekanism today.

## [The Bumblezone](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-bumblezone-forge)

The Bumblezone is a dimension filled with Honeycomb Blocks, Honey Blocks, Honey Crystals, Sugar Water, and few new bee-related Blocks! There's even a structure with unique bee armor you can obtain! And if you follow special Honey Compasses from the Cell maze structure, you may find a Bee Queen! The dimension itself looks like it is the inside of a bee nest and you will find giant walls in rows with canals of water between them along with giant columns providing support to the ceiling all over. Maybe you'll even find a pollen covered section of the dimension! The walls and columns are riddled with honeycomb holes and if you look carefully, you may find hidden caves inside! By default in the configs, entering Bumblezone will take your coordinates and divide it by 4 to get the new coordinates to spawn around at in Bumblezone dimension. When exiting Bumblezone, your coordinates will be multiplied by 4 and the game will look for a bee nest/beehive around that new coordinate in the target dimension. If it cannot find any bee nest/beehive to teleport you to, the game will teleport you to the original spot you were at in that dimension when you originally tried to enter Bumblezone. See the config file to change the teleportation mode.

 But that isn't all! Within the dimension, bees are extremely protective of their honey. If you mine vanilla's Honey Block, destroy or take honey from  Honeycomb Brood Block, or you hit a bee, all bees around you will get a speed, absorption, and strength potion effect and will become VERY angry at you! You will know you are in DEEP trouble when you get the Wrath of the Hive icon showing you got that effect and the fog in the dimension become more red! The bee will swarm you like crazy and will kill you unless you come very well prepared. A full set of unenchanted Diamond gear will not be enough but if you use a Bane of Arthropod V Diamond Sword, you might stand a chance. (but you can nerf the bees in the config if you find them too strong or buff them if you want to die!). And Bumblezone's experience can be enhanced when you have certain mods on such as Productive Bees!
