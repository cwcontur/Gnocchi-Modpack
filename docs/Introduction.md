# Movement

This modpack adds improvements/changes to movement in *Minecraft*.

### [Climb Ladders Faster](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/climb-ladders-fast)

Climb ladders much faster than vanilla *Minecraft*. It doesn't have to be tedious.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- Let go of movement keys and look up to go up faster, look down to go down faster.
</div>

### [Dashing](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dash)

A dashing mod that adds a new enchant to boots allowing you to dash around. You can obtain a Dashing enchantment book in the same way you can find Frostwalker and Mending books; from chest loot, fishing, raid drops, or trading. This mod is pretty lightweight and is a perfect vanilla+ mod (a mod that fits in with vanilla).

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- Once youâ€™ve enchanted your boots with Dashing, press `R` or your assigned keybind of choice to perform a Dash. You can change your keybind for dashing in your controls menu.
</div>

### [Going Prone](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/goprone)

A simple movement mod which lets the player go into a crawling pose to sneak through 1-block high gaps easily.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
    - Default keybind is `C` to go prone.
</div>

### [Leaping (double jump)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/leap)

Take a leap forward with this simple mod that adds a new enchantment that allows you to double jump! The Leaping enchantment can be obtained just like any other treasure enchantment, being available as loot in chests, fishing, or from the Librarian Villager. It can only be obtained in one level. The enchantment is exclusive to boots. You can use a double jump anytime your motion is moving downward.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- Simply press `space` to do a double jump while you're in the air.
</div>

### [Step](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/step)

Step up your vanilla experience with this mod that adds a balanced Stepping enchantment that allows you to walk up entire blocks. The stepping enchantment can be obtained similarly to Depth Strider, in an Enchantment Table. It can be obtained at around level 20+, on diamond boots for reference.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- No special movement is required, just walk up blocks.
</div>

### [Wall jumping & clinging](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wall-jump)

Wall to wall platforming in *Minecraft*! This mod adds wall jumping and double jumping to the game.

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
- **Wall Cling:** Jump towards a wall and hold the wall jump key `LSHIFT`
- **Wall Jump:** While wall clinging, keep holding `W` and let go of `LSHIFT` to wall jump.
</div>
